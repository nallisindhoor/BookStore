Setting up 2.5 hours . Part of this was just me setting some of the things up on my Mac book. 
Actual coding was around 7.5 hours, most of the hours on the 3rd and a couple hours here and there today. 

I have not used Angular to this extent previously so most of my time was still spent on understanding those concepts. I only had a rough idea when I started. 

Did not get to testing simply because I have not yet implemented the delivery cost calculating system for the user.  

How I will go about doing it: 
1. Write a better system to calculate the costs using enums and other options out there to calculate the delivery costs. 
2. Write tests to make sure the costs are calculated correctly. 
3. Write more logic and api calls from the server so we can manipulate it better. 
4. There is a lot of hardcoded bits of that cannot at this point be utilised widely, I would change that. 
5. The will separate the list api controllers to do each action so its more modular. 


The delivery details view will need another 1.5 hours easily.

I am using an api key I created for accessing google books api. 
I do not need it to look at general information about a book. 

The styling is not the most flashy, just does the job for now.
